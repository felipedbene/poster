Generate a detailed outline for a comprehensive 1500-word **parody article** on "{topic}".
Imagine it as a witty, sarcastic, or over-the-top humorous take.

Format your response as YAML with a 'sections' key containing a list of section headings.
Example:
```yaml
sections:
  - "Ridiculous Introduction: Setting the Stage for Absurdity"
  - "Overblown Claims That Make No Sense"
  - "Expert Opinions from People Who Don't Exist"
  - "Conclusion Full of Regret and Questionable Advice"
```

Include 4-5 creative section headings that would make for an engaging article structure.
